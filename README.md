- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwgrein.  I'm a software developer with over 20 years experience.  I have worked 
with Java, Embedded C, C#, Delphi and Ruby.  I focused mainly on backend system development 
in Java and Ruby before moving to embedded C and C# support apps for the past 2 years.    

- 👀 I’m interested in BlockChain, Smart Contracts and DApp development.  I see this becoming 
a new and growing market in the coming years and am hoping to get into this at an early stage.
To help facilitate this, I recently completed the eCornell Blockchain certification.

- 🌱 I’m currently utlizing Udemy courses to assist with my learning Solidity and Smart Contracts.
